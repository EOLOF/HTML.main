<p>
     From Valve (the creators of Counter-Strike, Half-Life and more) comes Left 4 Dead, a co-op action horror 
     game for the PC and Xbox 360 that casts up to four players in an epic struggle for survival against 
     swarming zombie hordes and terrifying mutant monsters. Set in the immediate aftermath of the zombie apocalypse,
     L4D's survival co-op mode lets you blast a path through the infected in four unique “movies,” guiding your 
     survivors across the rooftops of an abandoned metropolis, through rural ghost towns and pitch-black forests
     in your quest to escape a devastated Ground Zero crawling with infected enemies. Each "movie" is comprised 
     of five large maps, and can be played by one to four human players, with an emphasis on team-based strategy
     and objectives.    New technology dubbed "the AI Director" is used to generate a unique gameplay experience
     every time you play. The Director tailors the frequency and ferocity of the zombie attacks to your performance, 
     putting you in the middle of a fast-paced, but not overwhelming, Hollywood horror movie.
     Addictive single player, co-op, and multiplayer action gameplay from the makers of Counter-Strike and Half-Life
     Versus Mode lets you compete four-on-four with friends, playing as a human trying to get rescued, or as a zombie
     boss monster that will stop at nothing to destroy them. See how long you and your friends can hold out against
     the infected horde in the new Survival Mode. An advanced AI director dynamically creates intense and unique 
     experiences every time the game is played20 maps, 10 weapons and unlimited possibilities in four 
     sprawling "movies"Matchmaking, stats, rankings, and awards system drive collaborative play
     Designer's Commentary allows gamers to go "behind the scenes" of the game. Powered by Source and Steam

Om jag skulle betysätta Left 4 Dead från 1-10 skulle jag ge det 5/10. Det är ett bra spel som är välgjort, men är bara helt enkelt en
sämre version av Left 4 dead 2. Det är dock förståligt efter som att speler är äldre än 2an.
