    No other video game has unleashed my creativity like Minecraft. I've spent countless hours chipping away at blocks,
     gathering the necessary materials to complete the next masterpiece that would otherwise only occupy my mind's eye.
      I've also spent just as many hours exploring, spelunking and slashing my way through monsters with bravado.
       My character – my entire Minecraft world – constantly evolves into whatever I want it to be. I tell my own
        stories, I write my own destiny and I bring my fantasies to life one brick at a time.

Minecraft stands out not only for the way it inspires me creatively, but also because of its unique aesthetic.
 Look, I know the visuals look dated and a bit silly, but few games have visuals so endearing and charming.
  I know I'm not the only one who feels that way either, or else Minecraft's graphics wouldn't be so iconic.
   Could you take a texture from Gears of War, Halo or Uncharted, put it on a shirt and have players identify it?
    I doubt it. The looks just work, giving the game a super unique appearance that's memorable, and brings up a
     bit of nostalgia in me for 8-bit era games.

Om jag skulle betygsätta Minecraft från 1-10 hadde det fått 6/10. Det är ett roligt spel som jag spelat mycket för cirka 6 år sen.
Om jag jag skulle betygsatt det för 6 år sedan hadde det garanterat får 10/10, men efter som att mitt intresse för spelet gått ner under åren
får det en lägre bedömning.
