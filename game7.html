    Rainbow Six Siege is one of the most popular — and complex — first-person shooters on the current games market.
     A blend of milsim games and round-based tactical shooters like Counter-Strike, Rainbow Six exists in a niche that
      no other game truly fits into. Should you play Rainbow Six Siege? Well, that answer is complicated.
       Siege has had seven years and has many moving parts. Let’s divide it up into the varying types of players. 
       For better or worse, the Tom Clancy vibe is mostly gone from Rainbow Six Siege. It’s less dark and gritty and more vibrant
        and colorful, mostly for gameplay purposes. Siege is a first-person shooter at heart, the tactics and gadgets augment the 
        shooter mechanics. If you’re looking for a game like Squad or ARMA, Siege likely isn’t for you. It was always less 
        of what you wanted in a game from the beginning and is rapidly becoming less of what you want over time.
